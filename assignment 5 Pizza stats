// ------------- DESIGN -------------
/* 
Program Name: Pizza Stats program

Program Description: Calculate the correct amount of pizzas needed for the partys , then calculate the max amount of people at the party
max amout for pizzas and average pizzas

Design:
A. INPUT

number of people 
number of average slices per person
price per pizza

Define the input variables including name data type. 

B. OUTPUT
number of pizzas
amount for the pizzas
tax and delivery fees

Define the output variables including data types. 

C. CALCULATIONS
Describe calculations used by algorithms in step D.  
average slices / 8 slices per pizza = number of pizzas 
number of pizzas * the cost per pizza = toatal cost for party
total cost * .07  sales taxe
total cost plus tax * 0.2 = delivery fee



List all formulas. 
If there are no calculations needed, state there are no calculations.

D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
Design the logic of your program using pseudocode or flowcharts. 
Use conditionals, loops, functions or array constructs.
List the steps in transforming inputs into outputs. 
https://github.com/Glen-Sasek-PCC-Instructor/2025-06-22/blob/main/Pseudocode-Reference.txt
"do loop"
follow propts and answer y or n to continue 
if n then end program with final stats
