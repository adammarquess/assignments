/*Print the Ferries Fare Information menu to the user (see sample run and table below).

Note that the Bike Charge is included in the Vehicle Fee. Meaning if they have a Vehicle do not ask for the Number of Bikes. See sample run below for clarification.

Your program must prompt the user for information exactly as shown in the sample run below. This is a required coding construct.

If the user enters an invalid answer for the first question (use a char for this question and if they answer anything other than y/n), you must output an error message and end the program.

This question should accept both uppercase and lower case answers.

If the user enters any invalid numbers, print an error message and end the program. This could be negative numbers for any numbers, or unreasonable amounts for the number of people. No more than 20 people per group (not including the driver!).

Calculate the total price based on the ticket type and number of tickets.

If the total price is over $100, output a message saying they get a free adult ticket for their next trip. Else output the difference and tell them how much they need to spend to earn the free ticket.

Do not have any redundant code inside your if statements. You must have if else statements where appropriate or you may use switch statements.

No goto statements or break statements allowed except inside a switch statement.

Output the amount formatted to 2 decimal places with proper money formatting.

Look at the sample run below for examples.

Use this simplified fare table below for your calculations: */

// ------------- DESIGN -------------
/* 
Program Name: Wash. State Ferry Calculator

Program Description:
Calculate ferry pricing based on different variables including vehicles, adults, seniors, and youths.
produce correct pricing based on inputs

Design:
A. INPUT
Define the input variables including name data type. 
doubles: adults, seniors, youths, bikes
int: numAdults, numSeniors, numYouths, numBikes, vehicles

B. OUTPUT
Define the output variables including data types. 
pricing if valid inputs 
or error message if not valid

C. CALCULATIONS
Describe calculations used by algorithms in step D.  
List all formulas. 
If there are no calculations needed, state there are no calculations.
the calculation are : 

       totCharge = ((adults * numAdults) + (seniors * numSeniors) + (youths * numYouths)  + vehiclePrice)
       totCharge = ((adults * numAdults) + (seniors * numSeniors) + (youths * numYouths) + (bikes * numBikes))
       (numAdults + numSeniors + numYouths + numBikes) > 25)

D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
Design the logic of your program using pseudocode or flowcharts.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IYRSPIhEhS20ZYoYnDVvOlKv8xMoV7dT/view?usp=sharing
inputs :
adults- seniors- youths- bikes- vehicle -y or n 
output: calcultaed fare price 
if you are driving a vehicle - dont calculate bike
if more than 25 people - error
if less than 0 - error

Use conditionals, loops, functions or array constructs.
List the steps in transforming inputs into outputs.
